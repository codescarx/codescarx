- 👋 Hi, I’m @codescarx
- 🌱 I’m studying CS at UWaterloo
- 💻 Check out some of my side projects, like my [graphics engine](https://github.com/codescarx/SanctuaryEngine)

Sorry for there being so few repositories at the moment. After starting university, I decided to discard my old side projects and start fresh.

<!---
codescarx/codescarx is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
You can click the Preview link to take a look at your changes.
